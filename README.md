# Car-Crashes

Road accidents remains the leading cause of death of people aged between 1-54 years. Even after superior advancements in technology, road accidents continue to claim thousands of life. Below are some concerning facts-

More than 38,000 people die every year in crashes on U.S. roadways.
An additional 4.4 million are injured seriously enough to require medical attention.
Road crashes cost the U.S. more than $380 million in direct medical costs.
But these accidents can be prevented. To prevent these accidents we need to dive deep into the root causes of these accidents, understand the dynamics behind it and come up with a solution to tackle each of these issues.

The data set comprises of data from 49 states in the US collected from February 2016 to December 2019. It contains road accident data where each row represents a single accident and has 2.9 Million records. To focus on our answering our critical questions stated above, I decided to limit our crash data statistics to the year of 2016.

In this project, I have tried to analyze the reasons behind these car crashes in 2016 and have also provided insights to help reduce these car crashes. These analyses have been supported by visualizations. 

This project was done entirely on Jupyter notebooks using numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplot libraries. 

This repository contains the following:
1. The dataset used for this project 
2. A detailed code with data cleaning, data processing and data analysis codes and also 
3. A PPT containing all the insights and visualizations obtained.
